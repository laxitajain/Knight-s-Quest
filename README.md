A mario-like adventure game developed in Godot engine! 
A simple, yet captivating game built using Godot's own built-in scripting language, <b><i>GDScript</b></i>, a high-level, gradually typed programming language which is syntactically similar to Python.

An indulging experience with a groovy BGM, SFX, and customised GUI! 



Functional pickups, aka coins, and a scoreboard to further elevate the gameplay!

Have to thank @godotengine for its unmatched performance! Proved to be an excellent choice for a first gaming project, with well-organized layout, handy functionalities and easy-to-use interface.
I got a clear understanding of its node-based scene system, while working upon the game, which greatly simplifies the development process.
